# data_analysis_brownian_motion
Self-contained notebook containing data analysis from the experiments undertaken in Labs at UCL during December 2018. It 
briefly describes the methods used and results achieved. Typically data parsing for this experiment is done manually: here 
I propose an automatic parser for the data which allows for increase in size of dataset for analysis by roughly two orders 
of magnitude.
